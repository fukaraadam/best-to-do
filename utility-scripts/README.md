# Utility Scripts

Utility scripts to be used manually through development.

Note: `@rtk-query/codegen-openapi` is depends on `prettier` v2, which is not compatible with v3. So additional prettier config added to this package.

## ToDo

**Clean Up:**

- [ ] Remove coinGeckoApi codegen scripts from `./scripts/src/api-codegen/apicodegen.ts` and related swaggers.
